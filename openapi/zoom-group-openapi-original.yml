    The Zoom Groups API enables management of user groups within a Zoom account.

    This API provides endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete groups,
    as well as manage

    group membership. Groups help organize users for administrative purposes,
    permissions management,

    and streamlined meeting scheduling.
